# 02---COVID-19-Information-Dashboard
A website or app which offers users insight into a subset of the Coronavirus dataset from a recognised source (e.g. the UK Government's API).

During the pandemic, it has been most governments’ intentions to ensure that the latest data and statistics are publicly available, to help the general public understand both the severity of the current situation, and also to monitor the current status of the pandemic, e.g. in their local area.
To facilitate this process, a number of agencies have established comprehensive APIs to obtain up-to-date statistics on the pandemic. For example, the UK Government provides an API for downloading comprehensive and detailed Coronavirus statistics, https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/, as well as providing summarised data in the form of an information dashboard.
The objective of this project is to research information display and prepare a COVID-19 information dashboard which presents key information on the pandemic. You may wish to add functionality to allow the end-user to customise the way this data is displayed, or to edit which elements of data are shown, or – for example – to adapt and change search ranges.
